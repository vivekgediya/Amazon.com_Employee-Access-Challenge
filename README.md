# Amazon.com_Employee-Access-Challenge

The objective of Amazon.com Employee Access Challenge competition is to build a model, learned using historical data, that will determine an employee's access needs, such that manual access transactions (grants and revokes) are minimized as the employee's attributes change over time. The model will take an employee's role information and a resource code and will return whether or not access should be granted.
